what's a useEffect:
 is a way to run code after the component has rendered or when certain values (dependencies) change.
 Key Points to Remember
useEffect runs after rendering, not during it.
If you don't pass a dependency array, the effect will run after every render.
Passing an empty array ([]) ensures the effect runs only once after the initial render.
Adding dependencies ([dep1, dep2]) ensures the effect runs only when those dependencies change.
